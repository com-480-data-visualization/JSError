## Project goal

> - Include sketches of the vizualiation you want to make in your final product.
> - List the tools that you will use for each visualization and which (past or future) lectures you will need.
> - Break down your goal into independent pieces to implement. Try to design a core visualization (minimal viable product) that will be required at the end. Then list extra ideas (more creative or challenging) that will enhance the visualization but could be dropped without endangering the meaning of the project.

## Implementation pieces

### Map of Europe (minimal viable product)

We want to show a map of Europe where each country could be colored according to the selected parameters:

- Predominant religion
- Economic state perception
- How safe people feel? (we don't know if that's in the data)
- Civil partnership (QMARRIED)
- How old were you at your last birthday ( may show the age who believe the religion)
- Frequency of religious activities
- Support for same-sex marriage or not
- Does religion give meaning to life (Happiness) 


Coloring would be done based on the survey results and the color would correspond to the most common answer.

For each of the countries, we want to be able to click and compare the selected parameters with another country in plots.

For this section we would use the lecture about maps.

### Comparison country plots

When comparing countries we want to show the same plot for two different countries to highlight the differences or similarities of them.

We use interactive pie charts, and other graphs to show numerical and categorical data. Lecture on graphs.

### General correlation analysis

We want to answer a question if there is a correlation between economic state perception and religious groups, and if there is which religions stand out.

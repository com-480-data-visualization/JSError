## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

### Dataset

All datasets used in this project are sourced from the Pew Research Center. Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world. This project primarily selects data from the [International religion survey data](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion-datasets/international-religion-survey-data/), [U.S. religion survey data](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion-datasets/us-religion-survey-data/) and [International Restrictions on Religion Data](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion-datasets/international-restrictions-on-religion-data/). Below is our detailed data list:

- **2023-24 Religious Landscape Study (RLS) Dataset**: This survey was conducted among a nationally representative sample of adults to provide estimates of the U.S. population’s religious composition, beliefs and practices.
- **East Asian Societies Survey Dataset**: 10,390 adults across Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam about religious identify, beliefs and practices. The survey was administered from June to September 2023, in seven languages.
- **South and Southeast Asia Survey Dataset**: 13,122 adults across six countries in South and Southeast Asia about religious identify, beliefs and practices. The survey was administered from June to September 2022, in eight languages.
- **India Survey Dataset**: 29,999 Indian adults about religious beliefs and practices, religious identity, nationalism, and tolerance in Indian society. The survey was administered from Nov. 17, 2019, to March 23, 2020, in 17 languages.  
- **Western Europe Survey Dataset**: This survey, conducted from April to August 2017, involves more than 26,000 telephone interviews with randomly selected adults about the role of religion in public and private life, and views toward religious minorities. Data includes responses from 16 countries and in 14 languages. 
- **Central and Eastern Europe Survey Dataset**: This survey was conducted from June 2015 to July 2016 through face-to-face interviews in 19 countries and 17 languages with more than 31,000 adults. The survey gauged views toward religion in public life and national identity a quarter-century after the fall of the Soviet Union. 
- **Religion in Latin America Survey Dataset**: Over 30,000 interviews were conducted across 18 countries and Puerto Rico between October 2013 and February 2014.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa Survey Dataset**: More than 25,000 interviews were conducted in more than 60 languages and dialects across 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa between December 2008 and April 2009.
- **Global Restrictions on Religion 2007-2016**: A collection of data on government restrictions on religion and social hostilities involving religion, collected by human coding of more than a dozen publicly available.

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

The origins of religion can be traced back to at least 100,000 years ago, and it has continuously and profoundly influenced the development and continuation of human civilization. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently approximately 4,000 different religions and belief systems worldwide, closely linked to human social life, cultural traditions, and economic activities. Therefore, this project aims to use data visualization to display the distribution, evolution, and societal impact of global religious patterns.

- What patterns emerge in the religious population distribution across different countries? Are there significant regional differences?
- What is the relationship between religious beliefs and the local language, economic development, and cultural traditions?
- Which religions are primarily targeted by restrictions in different countries? How do these policies affect the religious practices and belief choices of the local population?


> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
